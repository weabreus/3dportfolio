        I have been working as a software developer since 2018 developing web
        applications for customers.
        <br />
        <br /> Before diving into the world of software development, I spent 16
        years in the Supply Chain sector. I believe this experience honed my
        problem-solving and analytical skills, which are vital in developing
        efficient and effective software solutions.
        <br /> <br /> In the last few years I have successfully implemented
        solutions for customers that have served over 300,000 users and made
        over 4 million dollars in revenue.
        <br /> <br /> I'm currently on the market to join a company to continue
        to grow as a Software Developer while helping my potential employer
        achieve its goals.
